## Goal

- The goal is to help a energy provider to reduce customer churn by analysing the factors and generating a hypothesis to reduce the churn.

## Approach and Files 

- [Data cleaning and exploration](https://github.com/yashmehta10/Customer-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/cleaning_and_exploration.ipynb)
  - This notebook goes through the process of cleaning data by filling null values, analysing heatmaps and imbalance of class labels.
- [Feature Engineering](https://github.com/yashmehta10/Customer-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/Feature-engineering.ipynb)
  - This notebook goes through the process making new features by checking correlations amongst the features. 
- [Model Creation](https://github.com/yashmehta10/Customer-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/catboost-model.ipynb)
  - This notebook goes through creating CatBoost model, hyperparameter tuning, plotting feature importance, and evaluating the impacts of providing discount to the customers with high likelihood of churning.
